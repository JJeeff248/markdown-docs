# Markdown Docs

> Allowing you to create stylish markdown files quick and easy!

## About

This has been created to help speed up the process of typing large markdown files. I found myself spending a lot of time trying to format my university assignments well so I decided to create this simple front end to enable me to efficiently create good-looking hand-ins faster.

## Features

* The app uses [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to render and export all markdown files.
* Export Markdown, PDF, or HTML files.
* Save and create in the cloud.
